## Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here

##Data 

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

The training data for this project are available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

## Install necessary packages 

library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(rpart) 
library(rpart.plot) 
library(RColorBrewer) 
library(rattle) 
library(plyr)

## Set the working Directory

setwd("~/GitHub/PLM")

## Loading the data into R

## Replace missing values with NA

train<- read.csv("~/GitHub/PLM/pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("#DIV/0!"), row.names = 1)


test<- read.csv("~/GitHub/PLM/pml-testing.csv", na.strings=c("#DIV/0!"), row.names = 1)

The training data has 19622 observations and 159 features, and the distribution of the five measured stances A,B,C,D,E is:

dim(train)

## [1] 19622   160

table(train$classe)

## 
##    A    B    C    D    E 
## 5580 3797 3422 3216 3607


###Partitioning the training set

separate training data ---> into training set and a validation set to  validate the model.

set.seed(123456)
trainset <- createDataPartition(train$classe, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
Training <- train[trainset, ]
Validation <- train[-trainset, ]
Feature selection

##Cleanup near zero variance features, columns with missing values and descriptive fields.

# exclude near zero variance features

nzvcol <- nearZeroVar(Training)
Training <- Training[, -nzvcol]

## exclude columns with m40% ore more missing values exclude descriptive columns like name etc

cntlength <- sapply(Training, function(x) {
    sum(!(is.na(x) | x == ""))
})
nullcol <- names(cntlength[cntlength < 0.6 * length(Training$classe)])
descriptcol <- c("X", "user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", 
    "cvtd_timestamp", "new_window", "num_window")
excludecols <- c(descriptcol, nullcol)
Training <- Training[, !names(Training) %in% excludecols]

##Model Train

Using Random forestas as our model for Classification and regression , as it is implemented in the randomForest package by Breiman's random forest algorithm (based on Breiman and Cutler's original Fortran code) 

library(randomForest)

 randomForest 4.6-7
Type rfNews() to see new features/changes/bug fixes.

rfModel <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = Training, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 10)

##Model Validation

Testing the model performance on the training set and also the cross validation set.

##Training set accuracy

ptraining <- predict(rfModel, Training)
print(confusionMatrix(ptraining, Training$classe))

The model performs great against the training set, yet  we need to cross validate the performance against the held out set and see if we have avoided overfitting.

##Validation set accuracy (Out-of-Sample)

Our model performance by cross validation set that we held out from training.

pvalidation <- predict(rfModel, Validation)

print(confusionMatrix(pvalidation, Validation$classe))

The cross validation accuracy is 99.5% and the out-of-sample error is therefore 0.5% 

Therefore the  model performance can be concluded as good.

##Test set prediction

The prediction algorithm for the test set is:

ptest <- predict(rfModel, test)
ptest

Levels: A B C D E
